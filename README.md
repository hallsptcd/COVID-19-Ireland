This is a detailed analysis and visualisation of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland in early January, 2022, in terms of the number of cases among the general population and among healthcare workers, the number of hospitalisations, ICU admissions, and the number of deaths, using daily figures released by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), and statistical information taken largely from the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) system, alongside an analysis of excess deaths using data from rip.ie.
